A beautiful, modern **Markdown editor** — a Typora alternative built around one idea Typora gets wrong: **every file opens as a tab in the same window**, not a new app instance. Browse a whole folder in the sidebar, flip between files in tabs, and write in a clean WYSIWYG editor.

> 一个更好看、交互更舒服的 Typora 替代品。打开新的 `.md` 文件时不会再新开一个窗口 —— 它会作为标签页在同一个编辑器里打开，方便你查找、阅读和编辑多个 Markdown 文件。

## Features

**Editing (everything Typora has)**

* Seamless **WYSIWYG live preview** (powered by Milkdown / ProseMirror) — type Markdown, see it render in place

* Slash command menu (`/`) for inserting blocks

* Tables, code blocks with syntax highlighting, **LaTeX math**, images, task lists, blockquotes

* Selection toolbar, link tooltips, smart lists

* **Source mode** toggle (`Ctrl+/`) for raw Markdown

**Beyond Typora**

* **Tabs** — open many files in one window (`Ctrl+Tab` to cycle)

* **Folder workspace** with a file-tree sidebar; create / rename / delete / reveal files in place

* **Command palette** (`Ctrl+P`) — fuzzy-jump to any file or command

* **Outline panel** (`Ctrl+Shift+L`) — click a heading to jump

* **Open in the same window**: double-clicking a `.md` in Explorer adds a tab instead of launching a new instance (single-instance + file association)

* Live word / character count & reading time

* Polished **dark & light themes** (`Ctrl+Shift+T`)

* Session restore (reopens your folder + tabs)

* Auto-refreshing file tree (watches the folder for external changes)

## Install

Download the latest installer from [**Releases**](https://github.com/BND-1/horse/releases):

- **Windows**: `HorseMD Setup x.x.x.exe` — builds are currently **unsigned**, so
  SmartScreen may warn on first run. Click **More info → Run anyway**.
- **macOS**: `HorseMD-x.x.x.dmg` — builds are **unsigned and not notarized** yet,
  so Gatekeeper may report the app as damaged. After dragging it to
  Applications, run once in Terminal:

  ```bash
  xattr -cr /Applications/HorseMD.app
  ```

  then open it normally. (Proper signing/notarization is planned — see
  [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).)

## Develop

```bash
npm install        # if Electron's binary download is blocked, set a mirror first:
                   #   ELECTRON_MIRROR=https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/
npm run dev        # hot-reload dev mode
npm run build      # bundle main + preload + renderer into out/
npm start          # run the built app
npm run dist       # package for the host OS (Windows NSIS / macOS dmg+zip)
```

Builds are unsigned — see [docs/development.md](./docs/development.md) for the
SmartScreen / Gatekeeper first-launch steps. Working in this repo with an AI

## Tech

Electron + Vite + React shell, with **Milkdown Crepe** as the editor engine. The shell (tabs, file tree, palette, outline, theming) is custom.
